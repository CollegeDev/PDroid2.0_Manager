## PDroid2.0 the Official Manager Application
### What is PDroid2.0?
PDroid2.0 is a Manager Application for the well known PDroid2.0 Framework (recommended) or the new OpenPDroid. The OpenPDroid Framework is a fork of 'my' Framework and only ported to Android 4.1.2 with some little changings. PDroid2.0 allows blocking access for any installed application to the following data separately:

* Device ID (IMEI/MEID/ESN)
* Subscriber ID (IMSI)
* SIM serial (ICCID)
* Phone and mailbox number
* Incoming call number
* Outgoing call number
* GPS location
* Network location
* List of accounts (including your google e-mail address)
* Account auth tokens
* Contacts
* Call logs
* Calendar
* SMS
* MMS
* Browser bookmarks and history
* System logs
* SIM info (operator, country)
* Network info (operator, country)
* IP Tables(until now only for Java process)
* Android ID
* Call Phone
* Send SMS
* Send MMS
* Record Audio
* Access Camera
* Force online state (fake online state to permanent online)
* Wifi Info
* ICC Access (integrated circuit-card access, for reading/writing sms on ICC)
* Switch network state (e.g. mobile network)
* Switch Wifi State
* Start on Boot (prevents that application gets the INTENT_BOOT_COMPLETE Broadcast)

### Why should I use this application?
* It is developed by the main core developer CollegeDev who knows a lot about the features PDroid2.0 supports especially the new ones, because he wrotes them
* Only ~300Kb filesize of the application (very small)
* Really small battery consumption -> it is not listed in the battery statistics
* In future it will provide FULL 256bit AES encryption technology -> nobody except you can access your private data
* You will get support for application AND framework if something went wrong
* NO background service needed
* NO permission required for the app to run and that will NEVER change
* No performance impacts

### Bug Report
If you've found any Bug in PDroid2.0 you can open a new Issue here on GitHub. Please describe the bug as precise as you can, this will help me a lot. If you're a German native speaker, you can provide a Bug Report in German too. It is recommended to attach a Logcat too (best would be one with verbose filter and one with error filter).

### Feature Requests / New Ideas
If you have any suggestion for PDroid2.0 or some good new Ideas you can just open a new 'enhancement' and I will have a look at it. It is also recommended to discuss new features inside the 'enhancements'. From time to time I will open new enhancements to give you the possibility to get involved in the creation of the features.

### Is there any manual for this Application?
Yes it is. I will upload it in the next few days.

### Can I take your source and compile or distribute it?
You're allowed to distribute the Application but not allowed to compile it without asking for permissions. If you want to compile it, please get in touch with me.

### When you will push the sources?
I will push the sources within the next few release(s) :-)
